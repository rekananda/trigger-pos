                                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
                                    roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years
                                    old. Richard
                                    McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one
                                    of the more
                                    obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the
                                    cites of the
                                    word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
                                    from sections
                                    1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
                                    Evil) by Cicero,
                                    written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
                                    during the
                                    Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes
                                    from a line in
                                    section 1.10.32
